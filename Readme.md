This is a machine learning project based on neural network from tensorflow package. The model is a deep neural model 
with two dense layers, and was trained by the mnist dataset.

### How does it work
You can write whatever single digit from `0 - 9` by hand through painter in windows system, and save it as a `28*28` pixel
image inside the Digits folder. All the name of the images should be continuous integers from 1 to infinite.

Then run the `main.py`, it should pop out the image of the digits one by one, while show the predicted result in the
running terminal.

*Note: 1. The predicted result might not be correct, but mostly it should work.  
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;2. You should have all necessary packages installed on your computer to make it work*
